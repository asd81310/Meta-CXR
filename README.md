# Meta-CXR
This code repository includes 3 methods used in our experiment:
The first is the Class augmentation we proposed in the paper, the CGAN used to synthesize pseudo-classes is refer to https://github.com/Gialbo/COVID-Chest-X-Rays-Deep-Learning-analysis. 
The second part is Reptile algorithm refer to orignal 


## Class augmentation
Class augmentation includes the training process of CGAN and the generating process of CXR pseudo-classe.



Reptile includes the Reptile algorithm we used in the experiment.  
MAML includes the MAML algorithm we used in the experiment.
